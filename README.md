# Silent Failure of Expo Camera.takePictureAsync

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug when using the Expo Camera API. The `takePictureAsync` method may fail silently if called before the camera has fully loaded. This results in unpredictable behavior, often without any visible error messages.

## Problem

The primary issue is the asynchronous nature of the camera's initialization.  Calling `takePictureAsync` before the camera is ready leads to a failure, leaving developers unaware of the problem.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring `takePictureAsync` is only called after the camera has been successfully initialized and is ready to take pictures. This is achieved using promises and the camera's status.
